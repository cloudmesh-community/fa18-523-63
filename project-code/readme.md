# Analyzing Big Data Sorting Algorithms
### Overview
This project contains code written for many different sorting
algorithms. The time complexity will be analyzed for each of
the used algorithms and reported appropriately. The code
design for this project is very simple. There is a class
definition in the file 'classdef.py' which calls all
other methods, except main.py. 


### Code Written by the Project Author
The only code that is written by the project performer
is the code in the following files:
* `classdef.py`
* `main.py`
* `bubble.py`
* `pysort.py`

### Code Written by Other Developers
The code in the following files was adapted from other
developers to fit the project syntax and nomenclature.
The code is theirs and I do not own any rights to this
code. This project simply benefits from their work.

* `heap.py`
* `insertion.py`
* `merge.py`
* `selection.py`
* `shell.py`
* `strand.py`

**See the acknowledgement section of the project report 
For the references to the code authors**

### Install and Setup
The requirements' references are listed in the project report.
* Spyder(Python3.7)
* Python3.7
* Python3.7 Standard Library
* Python Random
* Python Time
* 16 GB of RAM (Due to the generation of 10 million random numbers)
* Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4690K CPU  @ 3.50GHz (This level of CPU is sufficient)

### Running the Code
Once the Spyder IDE is opened, ensure that all of the `.py`
files in this folder are in the same folder and access console's CLI.
Depending on
the current working directory, the command syntax is as follows:
```
runfile('Project-Code/main.py', wdir='Project-Code')
```
